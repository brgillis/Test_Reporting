# TD-SHE-000006-global-validation

## Summary

This testing dataset comprises the input data needed for a run of the SHE Global Validation pipeline on a set of Euclid observations which have been processed by the SHE Analysis pipeline. When the SHE Global Validation pipeline is run, it performs the validation tests associated with this dataset.

The dataset used for this test campaign was a set of 119 simulated Euclid Wide observations, covering a sky area of 59.5 sq. deg.

## Relevant Tests and Test Cases

* T-SHE-000006-shear-bias
* T-SHE-000007-pdf-eps-s
* TC-SHE-100009-PSF-res-interp-star-pos-epoch
* TC-SHE-100027-CTI-PSF-epoch
* TC-SHE-100032-CTI-gal-epoch

## Data Description

The data included in this testing dataset consists of:
* Simulated Euclid VIS-channel images and associated data for each observation (0.5 sq. deg of spatial coverage each, 59.5 sq. deg total), processed by PF-VIS
* Object catalogs generated by PF-MER through processing the above VIS-channel images, for all tiles overlapping the selected observations
* Shear measurement catalogs for each observation, generated by the PF-SHE Analysis pipeline

Of note, we detail here the object selection performed for the tests using this dataset:
* The SHE Analysis pipeline provides shear estimated for all objects which are labelled in MER's catalog as being detected using only the VIS-channel data, regardless of whether these objects are labelled as stars or galaxies, and regardless of S/N
* For validation tests, only objects for which the shear estimate is provided without any error flags are used, and these objects are separated into those believed to be galaxies, those believed to be stars, and those of an unknown type

## Data Details

All data in this testing dataset is stored in the Euclid Archive Service (EAS), and can be viewed on the DBView web service (https://eas-dps-cus-ops.esac.esa.int/) or retrieved via the DataProductRetrieval.py script through querying it appropriately.

The following sections list the different types of data products required, plus the metadata values which can be used to query for them. In addition to the metadata values listed below, all queries should include ``Header.ManualValidationStatus.ManualValidationStatus!="INVALID"`` to properly exclude any invalidated data.
